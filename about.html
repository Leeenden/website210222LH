            <h2> About Us </h2>
            <p>  As time goes on, scientific research is unvieling an increasing number of benefits that can occur by taking part in regular physical exercise. More recently, research has indicated that long-term health and prevention of all-cause mortality can actually be predicted using an indidivuals own strength, more accuratley than other variables .</p>
            <p>It was found that weight-training / resistance training alone can infact be great for the cardiovascular system, and in some people, actually better than standard cardiovascular exercise (e.g. running) for improving their heart health. </p>
            <p> To summarise, as you grow older, the stronger you are relative to your age, the higher the chance that you're healthier and there is a higher chance that you will die older and with less age related ailments effecting a person. </p>
            <p> The goal of Supra Sapien fitness is to help any indvidual who wishes to push themself further than they thought they could go, achieve a physique they thought impossible whilst striving for longevity and maintaining mentaland physical health and wellbeing.

        <p>During the course I learned to code in python primarily. The first week we learnt the basic and fundementals. In the second week we were able to test what we had learnt. We were grouped up and asked to build a text-based adventure game in python which ran without errors. <br>
            
            In the final week we were taught the basics and fundamentals of HTML and CSS. With these new found skills I was asked to build a simple, working website.<br>
        
            This is that website.
